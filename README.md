# Fano

## Credit

Credit must go where credit is due, and this game is stolen straight off of Pagat's Invented Games.

I've implemented this first as a command line game, but obviously it is much better to turn it into a game beyond this.

## Notes to self

### Commands

Whenever I change the Javascript, go into the js folder and run the following command:

`browserify main.js -o bundle.js`

to sync it all up.

Also,

`python3 -m http.server`

in the base Fano directory is required to bypass Firefox's CORS request stuff.
